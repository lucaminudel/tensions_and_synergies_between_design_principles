# Tensions and synergies between design principles

Between different object-oriented design principles there are tensions and synergies.

A professional software developer should have an overall sense of all the forces at work in the code design when coding.

Ilias Bartolini developed a coding-dojo that a group of people can run multiple times to explore and develop a sense of the forces generated in the code by different design principles.

- This is the repository with the code for the [coding-dojo](https://github.com/iliasbartolini/design_principles_dojo).

- These are the instructions, the material and the [facilitatorâ€™s guide](https://github.com/iliasbartolini/design_principles_dojo_facilitator_guide)


- The group can document the tensions and the synergies experienced in the sessions of the coding-dojo, this is [the template](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzjBWmINdN4HQUJKMDEwSWdtZkU&usp=sharing)

- This is an example of a [graphical representation](http://www.slideshare.net/brain79/desing-principles-tensions-and-synergies-v30/16)

## Code examples
In this repo you find small code examples, each showing a tension or a synergy between two object-oriented design principles.

If you have more examples, please share them with a pull request.


## Additional Refactoring Coding-Dojo
From the original coding-dojo, attendees can refactor the 'Before' code by applying one design principle producing an 'After' code and then observing the tension with another design principle.

[Here](https://github.com/lucaminudel/tensions_and_synergies_between_design_principles/tree/master/SolvingTheTensions/) I'm adding more refactoring exercises where attendees are asked to refactor the 'After' code to resolve the tension by finding a good tradeoff.

For the facilitator, I've added a [C# example for the 'TensionBetweenSRPandEncapsulation'](https://github.com/lucaminudel/tensions_and_synergies_between_design_principles/tree/master/SolvingTheTensions/CSharp/TensionBetweenSRPandEncapsulation/) with a 'Worse' solution and a 'Beter' solution and some notes for the facilitator. More examples are needed for the other cases of tension and for the other languages.
